# DriveX
DriveX is an open-source project developed by Aditya Singh. 'DriveX' as the name is self-explanatory, an extension of Google Drive. Pushing the power limit of Google Drive with various features designed to ease the work and automate various workflows and customise google products by adding a custom frontend panel for different Google Apps. Yes I know that Google Apps Script is designed just to achieve that. But if everyone on Earth knew Js then job of web developer would never existed in first place.
